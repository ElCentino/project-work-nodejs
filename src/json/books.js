        "description": "We are living in the Business Age. The historic role of nation states is rapidly being replaced by the corporation. Like never before, Christian business leaders have the chance to play a pivotal role in transforming society and spreading the gospel. But seizing this opportunity requires thinking differently about God, about his kingdom, about his purposes in the world, and about business.\r\n\r\nWhile some Christian professionals dream of being \"freed from business\" to go into the ministry or see business as enemy territory to be invaded for Christ, others are convinced that Christian principles simply don't work in the \"real world.\" In Business as Mission, Michael Baer challenges each of these positions. He rejects the unbiblical thinking that ministry and business are by definition separate activities -- that our lives can be compartmentalized into the sacred and secular. Instead he guides business leaders in developing the vital characteristics of a kingdom business -- the kind of business that will free them to live fully integrated lives and lead organizations that significantly impact the world."

It is not the mentality of the slave of Christ. Professionalism has nothing to do with the essence and heart of the Christian ministry.

        "description": "We are living in the Business Age. The historic role of nation states is rapidly being replaced by the corporation. Like never before, Christian business leaders have the chance to play a pivotal role in transforming society and spreading the gospel. But seizing this opportunity requires thinking differently about God, about his kingdom, about his purposes in the world, and about business.\r\n\r\nWhile some Christian professionals dream of being \"freed from business\" to go into the ministry or see business as enemy territory to be invaded for Christ, others are convinced that Christian principles simply don't work in the \"real world.\" In Business as Mission, Michael Baer challenges each of these positions. He rejects the unbiblical thinking that ministry and business are by definition separate activities -- that our lives can be compartmentalized into the sacred and secular. Instead he guides business leaders in developing the vital characteristics of a kingdom business -- the kind of business that will free them to live fully integrated lives and lead organizations that significantly impact the world."

It is not the mentality of the slave of Christ. Professionalism has nothing to do with the essence and heart of the Christian ministry. The more professional we long to be, the more spiritual death we will leave in our wake. For there is no professional childlikeness, there is no professional tenderheartedness, there is no professional panting after God."
